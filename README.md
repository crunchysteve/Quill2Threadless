# Quill2Threadless
**An OpenSCAD design for a compnent that allows the use of a 1" quill stem on an 1 1/8" threadless steerer bicycle.**

**Quill2Threadless** is a way the get handlebar height adjustment on a modern bicycle without having to rebuild your entire threadless stack. If your bike's steerer tube has been cut to a given size, it's impossible to adjust raise your handlebar height without adding an ugly, clamping riser post. Now, don't gett me wrong, for everything else, threadless is a better format, but what if you could have both, without compromise? Still easy to tighten down the stack to keep steering tight, but also easy to laft the handlebar a bit at the end of a long day.

### How It Works
Instead of having a stem clamped around the top of the steerer tube, the Quill2Threadless serves as both a shim inside the steerer and a top cap to plle down on the spacer rings as the screw inside at the bottom is tightened into the starnut. At install, it also serves as a starnut driver to push the starnut deep down inside the steerer tube. When locked down byt the M5 capscrew down inside it, the Quill2Threadless top ring pulls down on the spacer rings, keeping the bearings seated in their races. Then a 22.2mm (7/8") quill stemm is inserted into the top, then tightened and adjusted just like the olden days!

### How Do I Get One?
Download the STL file and use a metal 3D printing service like JLC3DP or PCBWay to print it in your choice of stainless steel, aluminium (PCBWay only) or titaniam. The Selective Laser Melting process (SLM) gives a mid grey matt finish that's ready to be polished on a buff will with a polishing paste or perfect for sanding and priming to paint or podercoat to match your bike. (don't get too much coating on the inside, the tolerances are tight and the friction is needed for the quill to bind firmly inside. (links coming soon)
